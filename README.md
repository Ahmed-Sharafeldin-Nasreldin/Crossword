# Crossword Puzzle Generator

This project implements an AI to generate crossword puzzles using constraint satisfaction techniques.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to generate complete crossword puzzles given a crossword structure and a list of words to use. The crossword structure defines which squares of the grid are meant to be filled in with a letter, and the list of words provides the vocabulary for the puzzle.

## Files

- `crossword.py`: Contains classes to represent variables and the crossword puzzle itself.
- `generate.py`: Implements functions to solve the crossword puzzle by enforcing constraints.
- `data/`: Directory containing example structure files and word lists.
- `output.png`: Example output image generated by the program.

## Usage

To generate a crossword puzzle, run the following command:

python generate.py <structure_file> <words_file> <output_image_file>



Replace `<structure_file>` with the path to the crossword structure file, `<words_file>` with the path to the word list file, and `<output_image_file>` with the desired filename for the output image.

## How It Works

The program works by first enforcing node consistency, ensuring that every value in a variable's domain satisfies the unary constraints. Then, it enforces arc consistency using the AC3 algorithm to satisfy binary constraints. Finally, it uses backtracking search to find a complete solution to the puzzle.
